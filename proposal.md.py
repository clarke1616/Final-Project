### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to define the income tax class the user would be in and define their Taxable income, their tax due, and their tax rate. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will be able to print out line items 1 - 33 on the 1040 tax return

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will first make an outline of the tax structor and form a lost of input i will need to ask the user. I will then need to make functions that can
calculate different deductions and tax rates. After I have the functions, I will need to program them so they are called when they are relevent to the
user. I will use the IRS guide to filling out a 1040 to help guide me in the information needed to calculate the end result.
